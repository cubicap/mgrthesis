    abstract = {An intuitive concept of antialiasing is developed into very efficient antialiased line and circle generators that require even less amount of integer arithmetic than Bresenham's line and circle algorithms. Unlike its predecessors, the new antialiasing technique is derived in spatial domain (raster plane) under a subjectively meaningful error measure to preserve the dynamics of curve and object boundaries. A formal analysis of the new antialiasing technique in frequency domain is also conducted. It is shown that our antialiasing technique computes the same antialiased images as Fujimoto-Iwata's algorithm but at a fraction of the latter's computational cost. The simplicities of the new antialiased line and circle generators also mean their easy hardware implementations.},
