\chapter{Related projects}

This chapter describes other projects used for the implementation of the proposed compiler. It also describes multiple small compiler backends which were considered as candidate options.

\section{Jaculus}

Jaculus is a platform for programming microcontrollers using JavaScript. It uses the QuickJS JavaScript engine. Jaculus' core library Jaculus-machine is of particular interest for this work, as the library is used for implementing the compiler. Jaculus-machine implements high-level C++ abstractions around QuickJS and implements some core features for the runtime.

\section{QuickJS}

QuickJS is a JavaScript engine. The version used in the current version of Jaculus-machine implements the ECMAScript 2020 Language Specification\cite{ecma262}.

QuickJS is designed to have a small code and memory footprint, and to be easily embeddable in larger programs.

QuickJS represents individual JavaScript values as a tagged type union.

QuickJS uses reference counting for memory management.
