The source code of the current version of the Jaculus-machine library is available in the attached ZIP archive. The archive also contains the source code of the benchmarks used to evaluate the performance of compiler.

The library contains both old code, and code created as a part of this thesis. The newly created code is primarily located in the following directories, relative to the root directory of the library:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the directory \texttt{src/jac/machine/compiler},
    \item \texttt{src/jac/features/aotEvalFeature.h}, and
    \item the relevant files of the \texttt{tests} directory.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
An upstream version of the library is available at GitHub:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \url{https://github.com/cubicap/Jaculus-machine}
\end{itemize}

\noindent
To compile the library and execute tests, run the following commands in the root directory of the library:
\begin{minted}{bash}
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ ctest
\end{minted}

\noindent
Additional binaries are generated by this process:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{tests/bench} - executes a given program written in our JavaScript, and prints the time it took to execute it,
    \item \texttt{tests/mainCompFn} - performs a partial compilation of a single function (either to AST or to our IR).
\end{itemize}
